<p>I defended my PhD thesis! The thesis &ldquo;Robust Semi-supervised Learning: Projections, Limits &amp; Constraints&rdquo; is about exploring the limits of the guarantees one can give for whether a semi-supervised learner will outperform its supervised counterpart. In other words: the limits of the usefulness of additional unlabeled data in a supervised learning setting.</p>
<p>While it seems to make sense you would want such guarantees before using semi-supervised methods to incorporate unlabeled data into the learning process, we show that without additional assumptions, for many supervised learners, semi-supervised alternatives with strict non-degradation guarantees can not be constructed. Perhaps surprisingly, however, for some supervised learners/loss functions, semi-supervised methods can be constructed that give strict non-degradation guarantees. For details of how these concepts (guarantees, performance) were defined, please see the thesis itself. After thinking about this topic for such a long time, I&rsquo;m quite proud of how the thesis turned out. You can find it <a href="/thesis.pdf">here</a>.</p>
<p>(As an aside: the thesis is typeset using R&rsquo;s knitr package and Latex. You can find the source code to generate figures and text <a href="https://github.com/jkrijthe/RobustSSL">here</a>)</p>
<p>As part of the thesis defense, at most Dutch universities, you are expected to include a set of propositions, some pertaining to the core claims made in the thesis, some about your field of research and some about science/society in general. These were my propositions included in the thesis:</p>
<ol>
<li>Semi-supervised learning without additional assumptions, beyond those inherent in the supervised classifier, is possible.</li>
<li>One can guarantee performance improvement of some semi-supervised learners over their supervised counterparts.</li>
<li>Truly safe semi-supervised learning is impossible for a large class of commonly used classifiers.</li>
<li>Considering a classification method&rsquo;s performance in terms of the actual loss it minimizes at train time gives useful insights.</li>
<li>There is a limit to the usefulness of asymptotic results.</li>
<li>Rather than hoping for practice to better correspond to current statistical methods, we need new methods that better match the adaptive way statistics is used in practice.</li>
<li>The focus in statistical practice on hypothesis testing is feeding society&rsquo;s appetite to clear cut answers in a reality where none are available.</li>
<li>Data is uninteresting without a model, while a model can be interesting without data.</li>
<li>Publishers have become a dispensible part of scientific communication.</li>
<li>Our unwillingness or inability to define our actual goals, combined with a need for certainty, lead to surrogate measures (e.g. GDP, H-index, wealth, `likes' on social media) that are actively harmful.</li>
</ol>
<p>I again want to thank my opposition committee: Ludmila Kuncheva, Peter Grunwald, Jelle Goeman, Erik van den Akker and Tom Heskes for the insightful questions that made for a super enjoyable discussion.</p>
